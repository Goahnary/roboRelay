# roboRelay

This project is for the Communication Relay and Website for the RC car project for CS496.
 
##Running the Relay
To run the Relay, on the server that will be running it you will need to run "python roboRelayServer.py". This will start the process that will listen for the [roboCar](https://github.com/Goahnary/roboCar) on port 1337. It will also listen for the web interface on port 8008. 

##Running the Website
To run the website you will just need to make it accessible to your Webserver software.
